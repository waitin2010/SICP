2.1 Introduction to Data Abstraction
    Data abstraction is a methodology that enables us to isolate how a compaound data object is used from the details of how it is constructed from more primitive data objects.

    Selectors and constructors implement the abstract data in term of the concrete representation.

    Pair: a compound structure 
    cons:this procedure takes two arguments and returns a compound data object that contains the two arguments as parts.
    car:this procedure extract the first argument of parts
    cdr: this procedure extract the second argument of parts
