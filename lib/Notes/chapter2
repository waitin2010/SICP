data-abstraction barries: a powerful tools for controlling complexity.

		 	  By isolating the underlying representation of data object,
			  we can divide the task of designing a large program into
			  smaller tasks that can be performed separetely.
			  
			  abstraction barries isolate different design choices from each
			  other and permit different choices to coexit in a single program

generic procedure:        operate on data that may be represented in more than one way.

data-directed programming: a powerful and convenient implementation strategy 
	      		   for additively assembling systems with generi operations.

dispatching on type: the general strategy of checking the type of a datum and calling 
	       	     an approciate procedure is called.
